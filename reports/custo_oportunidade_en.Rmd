# Introduction

The comprehensive assessment of land value has become increasingly pivotal for understanding land-use dynamics and informing sustainable land management strategies, particularly in the context of prioritization for conservation and restoration sciences [e.g. @strassburg_global_2020; @strassburg_strategic_2019 ] . Despite its importance, accurate information on land value is rarely available at finer scales or in formats easily usable in research, such as raster datasets.

Since 2019, the Brazilian Government has annually published land value data (reais $ha^{-1}$) for a substantial number of municipalities and States across all regions of the country^[https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/pt-br/centrais-de-conteudo/publicacoes/documentos-tecnicos/vtn]. The provided information encompasses the following land use/cover categories: cropland with good, regular, and restricted suitability; planted pastureland; silviculture or natural pastureland; and natural vegetation. However, these data are presented in PDF format, with limited spatial coverage, hindering their application in comprehensive, nationwide studies.

Given this context, we present a rigorous methodology that integrates advanced geospatial analyses, agricultural production estimation, and machine learning techniques to predict land values across Brazil. Leveraging annual land use/cover data and agricultural suitability information at high resolutions, together with a diverse set of socioeconomic data, the outcomes of this study promise to enrich our understanding of the spatial patterns of land values in Brazil, thereby contributing valuable insights for land use planning, natural resource management, and informed decision-making, with a specific focus on conservation and restoration sciences.


# Methodological description
## Land value

The first step in our analyses was to standardize the data on land value provided by the Government by converting it from PDF into tabular format. We gathered available information for the years 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, adjusting monetary values to 2023 by accounting for accumulated inflation based on the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) [@banco_central_do_brasil_calculadora_2023]. Owing to technical constraints, we excluded data from 2020 as it was presented in a non-convertible image format. For instances of missing information within a specific land use/cover class, we applied the mean municipality value for silviculture, planted pasture, and natural vegetation. Regarding cropland, we substituted missing values at the municipal level, prioritizing the most conservative estimate. For example, if data for good suitability cropland was absent in a municipality, we used information from regular suitability for input.

## Land use and land cover and agricultural suitability

We used 2020 land use/cover data with 30 m resolution provided by Mapbiomas [@mapbiomas_mapbiomas_2023], reclassified into the following categories (Table 1): cropland, pastureland, natural vegetation, silviculture, ignored, other natural lands. we calculated the fraction coverage for each category within a 1 km resolution grid spanning the entirety of Brazil, employing the Mollweide projection.

  #  column_spec(3, width = "1cm")%>%
  #  column_spec(4, width = "3cm")
```


For the spatial information regarding agricultural suitability, we relied on the work of Safanelli et al.  [-@safanelli_grain-cropping_2023], who conducted a comprehensive study modelling soil, climate, and relief suitability for agriculture. Their dataset, characterized by a 30 m resolution, was used to calculate the mean suitability per cell of our 1km grid.

The integration of land use/cover data and suitability information enabled us to spatialize the land value data. This spatialized data served as the response variable in our land value model (Figure 1).

## Independent variables

We computed a series of co-variables aimed at predicting the distribution of land value across the Brazilian territory (Table 2). Notably, the determination of the production value, or the estimated value derived from agricultural and livestock activities, involved a more intricate calculation. The detailed steps for obtaining this value are detailed in the subsequent section.

### Production value

We determined the agricultural production value using data sourced from Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [@ibge_producao_2021]. Our methodology involved calculating the mean production in reais per hectare ($ha^{-1}$) for each Brazilian municipality weighted by the municipality's area dedicated to both temporary and permanent crops. Subsequently, we assigned a production value to each 1 km grid cell, based on the spatial location of each municipality and multiplied it by the fraction of agriculture covering the respective cell.

A similar approach was applied to estimate livestock [@ibge_pesquisa_2021] and silviculture [@ibge_producao_2021-1] values. For livestock, we aggregated the production values of wool, beef, and milk per municipality per hectare, multiplied by the fraction of each grid cell covered with pastureland. Regarding silviculture, we utilized the production value of silviculture, multiplying it by the coverage of silviculture within each cell of the grid.

## Fitting a predictive model of land value

We employed a Random Forest approach to fine-tune a regression model, establishing a relationship between the land value data and the independent variables detailed in Table 2. To enhance efficiency, we stratified the data across the five Brazilian territories: North (*Norte*), Northeast (*Nordeste*), South (*Sul*), Southeast (*Sudeste*), and Central-West (*Centro-Oeste*), considering their socioeconomic similarities to bolster model accuracy (original Portuguese names in  parentheses).

Within each region, we conducted a stratified sample, factoring in the municipality's land value data area, selecting 30% of the dataset (except for Northeast and North, where we sampled 50% due to limited coverage). Subsequently, we partitioned the data into a training set (70%) for model fitting and a testing set (30%) to assess accuracy. To streamline the model, we computed a correlation matrix among potential numeric predictive variables, incorporating only those with a correlation value below 0.7.

The Random Forest models were fitted using the 'randomForestSRC' package [-@randomforest_2008] with 200 trees and nodes set to n=20. Model accuracy was evaluated through $R^{2}$ and RSME. Following model generation, we predicted land use values for all cells within our 1 km grid for each region, which were then consolidated into a unified raster for the entire country. All data handling and model fitting was done in R [@rcore]

# Results

Our exploration of variable correlations within each of the five Brazilian territories revealed collinearity among several variables in all regions (Figure 2). Notably, this examination guided our model refinement process, ensuring that only variables with correlation values below 0.7 were included in the final models. We removed: distance from mining sites, proportion of agriculture GDP and number of tractors (South region); urbanization, proportion of agriculture GDP (Southeast); distance from mining sites, distance to ports, HDI, agriculture subsidies, proportion of agriculture GDP, number of tractors (Northeast); production value, HDI,proportion of agriculture GDP (central-West); proportion of agriculture GDP, distance to ports, HDI(North).

The Random Forest models exhibited remarkable accuracy across all regions, with consistently high R-squared values and low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (Table 2). The models achieved $R^2$ values exceeding 0.9, highlighting their robust ability to explain the variance in land values, and RMSE below 2, underling the accuracy in predicting land values.  The outcomes of my model could suggest potential overfitting. However, this is not a concern in this context, as the model is being used to interpolate values and fill missing data within the same region from which the data originates. The model is not being used to predict values in unsampled regions, but rather to provide complete coverage of the existing dataset. Our choice of tree number was also adequate and allowed fast processing with high accuracy (Figure 3).

Variable importance analysis provided additional insights into the factors driving land value predictions. Key variables, such as agricultural production value estimates, land use/cover categories, and socioeconomic indicators, consistently emerged as significant contributors. (Figure 4).

Applying our Random Forest models to extrapolate land values across Brazil resulted in detailed spatial predictions for each region. We extrapolated the land values for each region, providing a visual representation of the spatial distribution predicted by our models (Figure 5). These extrapolated values were subsequently mosaiced into a unified raster, offering a comprehensive nationwide overview of land values (Figure 6).

The creation of a spatially explicit raster layer of land value for the Brazilian territory at a 1km resolution, based on Brazilian Goverment official data and relevant covariables, provides significant advantages over traditional PDF reports with incomplete coverage. This comprehensive layer allows for a uniform and continuous assessment of land values across the entire country, facilitating better-informed decision-making in spatial planning and resource allocation. The use of covariables enhances the model's accuracy and extrapolation capabilities, capturing the intricate variations in land value influenced by multiple factors.

However, this approach is not without limitations. One notable challenge is the lack of available land value data for certain regions, which can affect the model's accuracy in those areas. Additionally, the values provided by municipalities or states tend to be underestimated since they are often calculated for tax purposes, which may not reflect the true market value. Nonetheless, this issue is likely uniformly distributed across regions, minimizing any significant spatial bias.

Despite these limitations, the raster layer serves as a valuable asset for indicating relative land value across Brazil. While the absolute values should be interpreted with caution, the relative information is instrumental in identifying areas of higher or lower land value. This insight is particularly useful for spatial planning, enabling researchers and stakeholders to make more strategic decisions regarding development and conservation.
